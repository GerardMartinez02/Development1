# Videogame Development
## Development task 1 (First test of a level)

In this project we have made a great series of tests and advances in the development of our code profile in c ++ and XML. Working with these two to finally end up creating this first level prototype.

We would like to emphasize that we have had several complications throughout the process, and many ambitious ideas have been discarded in this first assignment. Also, this is what programming is about, realizing what you are able to do in a period of time, and obviously make it work. However, we know that the learning obtained during these last weeks will help us achieve our objectives and get those ideas that we had at the beginning of the project done for the last release.
